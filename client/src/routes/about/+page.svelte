<h2 class="subtitle">Features</h2>
<h3 class="feature">Dashboard</h3>
<p class="content">The dashboard of the student visualization web application will serve as a central hub for monitoring and addressing behavioral issues across the South Brunswick School District. It will feature comprehensive ratings and rankings for each school, highlighting key issues such as cheating, fighting, and absenteeism. A worm chart will visually display the frequency and trends of these incidents over time, differentiated by school, allowing for quick identification of problematic periods. Additionally, the dashboard will include a detailed list of recent incidents, providing crucial information such as the involved students, incident type, school, and date. This real-time data will empower school officials to respond swiftly and effectively, enhancing the overall school climate and student conduct management.</p>

<h3 class="feature">Trends</h3>
<p class="content">The trends page of the student visualization web application will empower faculty to observe and analyze correlations between various behavioral and demographic criteria. By selecting a primary trait to investigate, such as cheating incidents or GPA, faculty can compare it with secondary traits like race or income to uncover significant patterns and relationships. The AI-driven system will further enhance this process by automatically suggesting the strongest correlations once a primary trait is chosen, highlighting areas that warrant closer attention. This feature will facilitate a deeper understanding of the factors influencing student behavior and performance, enabling targeted interventions and policy adjustments to address specific needs within the district.</p>

The AI is also equipped to generate various types of graphics, including pie charts, bar charts, and worm charts, to visually represent the data and provide clearer insights. This feature ensures that faculty can easily access and interpret complex information, enabling them to make informed decisions and implement effective strategies to address and mitigate behavioral issues in their schools.</p>
